<p>Analysis can be a primary focus on a 4-Day. You will find that you can logically confront any dilemma you are presented with. You will also be better able to promote or disclose your ideas to the whole group, rather than one-on-one. People in the workplace identify you as a resource to their company, Eleven, because you usually are aware of where everything is and what is going on.</p>
